## Description

_Task1:_ Community Detection using Girvan Neuman Algorithms-
Case 1: Calculate betweenness
Case 2: Detect Communities

# Task: Apply Girvan Neuman Algorithms

_Case 1:_ Calculate betweenness using the Algorithm between users and create a graph

_Case 2:_ Based on betweenness detect communities - Community detection requires calculating modularity of partitioning graph

## Note:

The assignment was given as a part of course Data Mining at USC. I have no rights over the question. However the code is my own. It was performed on yelp data, the files named under business.json and review.json- to which I have no proprietary right.
